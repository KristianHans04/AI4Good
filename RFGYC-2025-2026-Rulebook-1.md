RULEBOOK
2025-2026
a. Theme of the Challenge

2
As agriculture faces increasing pressure from resource constraints
and a growing global population, food systems must adapt to meet
ever-higher demand while maintaining productivity and economic
viability. It is essential to optimize the use of available land and water,
improve efficiency, and ensure equitable access to agricultural products.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO), “agriculture must meet the needs of present and future
generations for its products and services, while ensuring profitability and
social and economic equity” (FAO, 2014).
In the face of these challenges, technology has become a key ally in
transforming agricultural practices. For example, precision-agriculture
technologies such as GPS-guided machinery have revolutionized sowing
and harvesting, allowing farmers to maximize yields and reduce waste.
Drone technology is also widely used to monitor crop health and optimize
irrigation systems, demonstrating the practical impact of technological
advances on agriculture. Breakthroughs in robotics and artificial
intelligence offer innovative solutions to optimize resource use, increase
efficiency, and protect biodiversity. Agricultural robots have the potential
to perform critical tasks such as crop selection, irrigation, pest control,
and harvesting, minimizing waste and maximizing precision.
In this context, the Robotics for Good Youth Challenge 2025-2026,
curated by make+learn, focuses on tackling these critical issues through
robotics applied to agriculture. The competition challenges participating
teams to design, build, and program robots capable of solving real-world
problems in the agricultural sector, fostering technological innovation
worldwide.
Teams, which may include a maximum of eight participants, will work
with robots designed to identify crop needs, allocate water efficiently,
and manage pest control. These tasks address key agricultural
challenges, such as ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water
to avoid waste during droughts, reducing the use of harmful pesticides to
protect ecosystems, and optimizing available resources to increase field
yields. Through these simulations in a competitive environment, students
will experience how technology can transform traditional agriculture into
a more resilient practice that is better adapted to today’s challenges.
The Robotics for Good Youth Challenge 2025-2026 emphasizes the
importance of collaboration and creativity in tackling critical challenges
in agriculture. Through this competition, participating children and young


3
people can develop practical and innovative solutions that help drive
technologies with a positive and lasting impact on food systems and the
environment.
Taking part in this challenge not only provides hands-on experience in
engineering and programming, but also inspires children and young people
to imagine new possibilities for robotics applied to the agricultural world.
b. Mission for the Teams
In this year’s challenge, the mission is divided into two main actions
inspired by real agricultural processes: selective cultivation and
irrigation, and fruit harvesting and sorting. The game field is designed
to simulate these processes and test the robots’ ability to operate
autonomously within a limited time.
Each match lasts 2 minutes, during which the robots must operate
autonomously, with no human intervention once the round begins.
Start zone
Each robot (or set of robots) must begin entirely within a clearly defined
area marked by a black line at the bottom of the board. Each team may
place as many robots as can fit completely inside this area, although
using multiple robots is optional.
This zone is marked with 20 mm wide black adhesive tape. The same
type of tape may also be used in other areas of the field to indicate
specific zones or reference points.
Mission 1: Cultivation and Irrigation
At the top of the field there are three crop plots in different colors (orange,
gray, and green), each made up of a 2×3 grid of squares. At the start
of every match, the referee selects two of these three plots, leaving one
unused. This selection will be symmetrical for both teams, meaning that
the same two active plots will be used on each half of the board.
•Step 1 – Planting: While the robot is inside the start zone, it may
receive seeds from a team member. The team has a total of 18 seeds
(6 of each size) and may transfer them to the robot all at once or at
different moments, depending on their strategy. There is no limit to
the quantity or number of transfers, as long as it is done while the
robot is inside the start zone.

Each seed type corresponds to a specific plot color:
◦ Small seed A grey plot
◦ Medium seed A green plot
◦ Large seed A orange plot
Next, the robot must navigate to the corresponding plots and properly
deposit the seeds to promote plant growth.
•Step 2 – Selective Irrigation: Once plots are sown, the robot must
water only those containing seeds. It does this by opening a gate that
drops two blue balls as a symbol of water. Watering a plot without
seeds may incur a penalty.
Note: Robots may move over the crop plots if needed, although it
is recommended to do so before planting, to avoid displacing the
seeds once they have been placed by the robot itself. Mission 2:
Harvesting and Sorting
Mission 2: Harvesting and Sorting
On one side of the board there are three rows of pieces in different colors
(green, red, and black), one of which is elevated on a wooden platform.
These pieces represent fruits in various states:
• Green: unripe fruit (must not be harvested)
•Red: ripe fruit (must be harvested and placed in the area called
“Fruits”)
•Black: diseased fruit (must be removed and placed in the area
called “Waste”)
The robot must collect only the red and black pieces and transport them
to their respective sorting areas. The green pieces must not be moved
under any circumstances.
The two missions can be carried out in any order chosen by the team,
or even in parallel if more than one robot is used. Completing all actions
is not mandatory, and there is no penalty for missions that are not
performed.

an elimination phase.
2. Round organization:
2.1. Each team will play a minimum of two rounds in the qualifying
phase.
2.2. Matches are paired. Two teams compete simultaneously on the
two competition fields of the same game board (each team uses
one competition field).
3. Qualification:
3.1. Teams are ranked based on their highest score obtained during
the qualifying rounds (from highest to lowest).
3.2. In the event of a tie, the following criteria will be applied in order:
• The number of absences will be considered (from lowest to
highest).
• If there is still a tie, the total sum of points obtained across all
qualifying rounds will be considered only for the teams that
have the same maximum score (from highest to lowest).


20
• If the tie still persists, the tie can be resolved by ignoring all the
negative points and adding up only the positive score from
both qualifying rounds.
• Finally, if the tie remains, the ranking will be decided randomly
among the tied teams.
4. Elimination phase:
4.1. Depending on the number of teams per category, the elimination
phase may include pre-quarterfinals and/or quarterfinals to
determine the semifinalists.
4.2. In the pre-quarterfinals and quarterfinals, teams are ranked
based on the total points obtained in that respective round.
4.3. From the pre-quarterfinals, the eight highest-scoring teams
advance to the quarterfinals. From the quarterfinals, the four
highest-scoring teams advance to the semifinals.
4.4.Head-to-head knockout duels are applied only from the
semifinals onward (semifinals and final).
4.5.Pairings in the elimination phase follow a crossover format (1st vs
last, 2nd vs penultimate, etc.).
4.6.Winners of the semifinals advance to the final; the losing teams
compete in a consolation final to determine 3rd place.
5. Incidents:
5.1. Any serious incident during a match will be reviewed by the
referee committee.
